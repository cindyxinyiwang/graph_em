2. Each folder contains generated graphs of the grammar trained on the corresponding graphs
	as: trained on autonomous systems graph
	cit: trained on citation graphs
	ba: trained on barabasi albert graph
	ws: trained on barabasi albert graph
	twba:  trained on watts strogatz graph
	twws: trained on watts strogatz graph
