# graph em

This project contains code to run EM algorithm for graph grammar on a tree
`new_em.py` contains main EM code and related tree construction/reading code

`analysis.py` contains code that runs various experiments

`get_grammar.py` contains code that outputs a n-split grammar 

## Grow a graph
- git clone the following project in `graph_em`: 
	`cd graph_em`
	`git clone https://github.com/nddsg/PHRG.git`
- Added the folder PHRG (which are the necessary files from the nddsg:Phoenix project) 
  This lets us use probabilistic generation to grow a graph
