This folder contains generated graphs from the four graph grammars. For each training graph, 1, 2, 3, 4 split grammars are extracted and trained. Each version of the grammar generated 50 graphs, each of size 5000

1. as-train-topo
The as-train-topo.txt is the training graph for autonomous system graphs
The as-train-topo folder contains grammar extracted from the as training graph, and the generated graphs from each grammar. Each graph has a 1, 2, 3, 4 split grammar, and each folder contains 50 generated graphs, each of size 5000.

2. cit-HepTh
cit-HepTh.txt is the training graph for citation networks
cit-HepTh folder contains the generated graphs

3. ba
ba.txt is the training graph for barabasi albert graph
ba folder contains the generated graphs

4. ws-train
ws-train.txt is the training graph for ws graph
ws-train folder contains the generated graphs

graph_stats.py is the python script that used to calculate graph statistics of the generated graphs, as well as their similarity with the training graphs
